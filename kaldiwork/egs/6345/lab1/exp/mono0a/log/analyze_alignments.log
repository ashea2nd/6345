Overall, w accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,19.8,29) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 29.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 71.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (13,16.6,40)
