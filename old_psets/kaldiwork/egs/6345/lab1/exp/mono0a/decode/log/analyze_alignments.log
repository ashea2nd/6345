Overall, uw accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,18.7,34) frames.
Overall, ih accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.3,8) frames.
Overall, k accounts for 2.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (13,13.9,23) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 30.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 71.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 2.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,16.0,37)
